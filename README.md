Students are having a hard time finding a suitable place to study these days, some of them do not wish to travel to school just to study, especially if they live far from school. They wish to find a conducive environment with no distractions for them to study. This is where Locata comes in. Locata is a mobile app that allows students to find study locations for them to study. Students will be able to find cafes or libraries around them and select how far they want the study spots to be. They can also bookmark the places they wish to go to and view them again afterwards in the favourites tab. Students can also store their information which will be used for logging into their accounts. We used Google Maps API, Google Places API and Firebase API for this app.

This application was written for ST2226 Mobile Application Development II Project AY17/18.
